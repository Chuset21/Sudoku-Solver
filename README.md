# Sudoku Solver

A project that started as an idea to visualise a sudoku solver backtracking algorithm.  
This is still the main feature. Features include:

- Sudoku Generator, with difficulty choices.
- Sudoku Solver (visualised).
- Slider to change the speed of the visualisation of the solving algorithm.
- Hint button which gives you the right value for a random cell.
- Ability to input numbers yourself and have the application approve or deny them.

I might add a downloadable executable or something similar at some point.
